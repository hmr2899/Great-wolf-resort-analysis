# Great Wolf Resort Analysis

## Problem Statement
Great Wolf Resorts wants to find the optimal pricing for its burgers. For this reason, its management is interested in running a test on their burger prices and has expressed interest in knowing what test plan we would recommend for them. We have sales information by item (burger vs pizza), meal time, date, and property. In addition, there are some other data related to how busy the park was, number of occupied rooms, number of adults and number of children.

### Test Scenario 1
 The task is to do a simple paired test where one group will receive the current pricing and the other group will receive the increased burger price for a fixed period of time. Select balanced test and control groups; you have flexibility to choose the response variable, the level of date aggregation (monthly, weekly, daily), the time frame (some resorts don't have a full year of data), the amount of dynamic time warping, the number of resorts that are paired, whether you output the suggested splits or choose based on other r output related to the analysis
 
### Test Scenario 2
The task is to do the entire test within just one property. We will have four different burger pricing levels (+$0.0 â€“ control, +$0.25, +$0.50, +$.75) across two different mealtimes (lunch/dinner) and two different times of the week (weekday/weekend). Weekday = Mon-Thurs and Weekend = Fri-Sun
